    <h4>Introduction to Cultivation</h4>
    <p>At the formation of the universe, what happened was that all of the grandmist energy gathered into a singularity. This singularity constantly absorbed energy, compressing it over and over again, and when that energy reached the limit it would erupt!</p>

       <p>After erupting, the energy would cool down, forming space, time, yin and yang, the five elements, and finally evolving into all of life.</p>
        <p>
        This was the so-called great eruption of the universe. The Divine Realm’s 3000 great worlds and the lower realm’s billion boundless worlds, all of these were formed after this explosion. And before this explosion, neither time nor space existed.</p>
        
     <p>And a martial artist’s cultivation process was similar to this great eruption.</p>
        
       <p>The human body is a small universe!</p>
        <p>
        The evolution of the human body could be reflected in the great universe.</p>
        <p>Essence, energy, and soul were the three treasures that comprised a human being, the life vigor of an individual. Essence was vitality, power of the bloodline, the very basis of the mortal body. Energy was origin energy and the dantian’s true essence. The soul was the primordial spirit, the marriage of spirit and will.</p>

          <p>The mortal body, inner world, and soul were the three most important parts of a martial cultivator. When a martial artist practiced martial arts, it was to enhance and temper these three parts; that was the ultimate manifestation of a martial artist’s cultivation</p>
          <p><b><i>From ancient time relics it is found that Earth is the Weakest realm in the terms of cultivation due to the sparseness ot essence of Heaven and Earth.</i></b></p>
